Yet another [vim-characterize][] written in Lua on Neovim.

[vim-characterize]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-characterize

## Motivation

This is a fork of [vim-characterize][] written by Lua on Neovim. I (will) add Neovim-specific features and rewrite it by Lua for more speed and extensibility.

## TODO

* [ ] Customizable format for `info()`.
* [ ] Floating windows to show info.
* [x] Publish methods to use in other extensions such as statuslines.
* [ ] Catch up the the latest Unicode table.
* [x] Screenshots.
* [ ] docs.
